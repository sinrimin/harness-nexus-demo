/**
 * A page's action in the topbar (`PageSlot slot="actions"`).
 *
 * The bar is 48px on a phone and already holds the drawer button, the page's
 * identity and three toggles, so the action shrinks to its ICON below `sm` —
 * the label moves into `aria-label`/`title` where it is still announced — and
 * shows icon + label from `sm` up. Every topbar action is a create today
 * (`+`), which is what made the inconsistency visible: two pages had grown
 * their own `hidden sm:inline` span while six had not, so the same bar showed a
 * `+` on one page and a wide labelled button on another. Reported as "统一显示
 * 为 + 号就行了" — one component, so "uniform" is a property of the code rather
 * than of remembering.
