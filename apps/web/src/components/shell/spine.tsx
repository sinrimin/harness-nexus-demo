/**
 * The spine (01-skeleton.md §2) — the numbered section address column.
 *
 * Numbers are addresses, not counters: `01`…`05` come from the nav manifest, so
 * hiding a section (ADMIN for a non-admin) never renumbers anything. That is
 * why BAY's CSS `content: '01\A NAV'` had to go — it could not know the list.
 *
 * Narrow (#23, reported from a phone): 72px of column for two or three glyphs
 * was mostly air, so the bay runs SIDEWAYS now — the address stays legible
 * across (`01`), the engraved name reads down (`ACCESS`), and the strip costs
 * `--spine-w`. The name is the manifest's English label, never the translated
 * one: a bay is an address, and the same rail has to read the same in both
 * locales.
 *
 * Desktop only (≥900px): below that the plate hides too, and the sections move
 * into the topbar's nav menu + drawer.
